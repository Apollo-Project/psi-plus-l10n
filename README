This is the special repository with translations for the Psi+ and Psi projects:
  http://psi-plus.com/
  http://psi-im.org/

Homepage: https://github.com/psi-plus/psi-plus-l10n

Translations are managed via Transifex web service:
  https://www.transifex.com/tehnick/psi-plus/

If you want to begin new translation or update an existing one you should simply
register in Transifex and use its standard mechanisms for creating of new
translation or for joining translators team.

You are free to choose the way in which you want to update the translation:
* you may edit translation file via Transifex web interface from everywhere
* you may download translation file, edit it in any editor which you like
  (we recommend Qt Linguist for this) and upload updated file back

Transifex has quite good documentation:
  https://docs.transifex.com/

If you want use only web UI you do not need to read anything because web UI is
very simple and you may just begin to work.

But if you want to manage translations manually you may use special command-line
program transifex-client. It has simple syntax similar to git:
  https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction

you have any troubles with this repo.

If you want to fix one or two words in some translation, you may just write
about them here: https://github.com/psi-plus/psi-plus-l10n/issues
But for more amount of changes please join to our translators team.
